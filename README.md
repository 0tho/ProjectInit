# ProjectInit

This is a project that I wrote in 2012 for quickly scaffolding a project.
It uses a json like syntax to create a folders/files structure.

This project files were forgotten until I talked about it in a job interview, so I decided to give it a git repository.

At moment I don't have any intention to further develop this software.
